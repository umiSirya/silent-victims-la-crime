### **Introduction**  
Crimes against children in Los Angeles are a serious concern, yet patterns often go unnoticed due to messy or incomplete data. This project aims to clean LAPD crime data from 2020–2025 and use visual analysis to uncover trends in offense types, locations, demographics, and weapons used—helping stakeholders better understand and address child-targeted crimes.



### **Objective**  
To analyze and visualize child-targeted crimes in Los Angeles by identifying key trends, affected groups, and geographical hotspots, with the aim of supporting data-driven policy and law enforcement strategies that improve child safety and accountability.



### **Dataset Description**  
The dataset used in this project was sourced from the U.S. Government’s open data portal:  
[Crime Data from 2020 to Present](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present)

It includes detailed reports on crimes committed within the City of Los Angeles between 2020 and 2025, including crime types, victim age and gender, location, weapon used, and arrest outcomes.



### **Key Business Questions**  
1. Which crimes are most commonly committed against children?  
2. What areas in LA have the highest concentration of reported child victim cases?  
3. What is the gender distribution among victims?  
4. Which descent group has the highest or lowest average victim age?  
5. How has the number of reported victim cases changed from 2020 to 2025?  
6. What are the most frequent tools of harm in child-related offenses?



### **Tools Used**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python)  
- **Tableau** (Data visualization and dashboard design)  
- **GitHub** (Version control and project documentation)



### **Key Findings**

**1 in 3 Reported Crimes Involve a Child Victim**  
29% of all reported crimes in LA involve child victims, while 71% involve adult victims.

**Age Groups Most Affected**  
Children aged 13–17 years are the most affected, accounting for 38% of cases, followed by those aged 6–12 at 33%.

**Low Arrest Rate**  
Only 27% of reported child-related crimes result in adult arrests, highlighting a significant gap in accountability and enforcement.



### **Recommendations**  
- Enhanced law enforcement presence and training  
- Focused prevention programs for adolescents  
- Accessible and anonymous reporting systems  
- Increase patrol and intervention in crime hotspots



### **Dashboard**  
A Tableau dashboard was created to visualize patterns in child-related crimes across time, locations, demographics, and methods of offense. It aims to support stakeholders in understanding where and how to intervene for better protection and policy-making.
